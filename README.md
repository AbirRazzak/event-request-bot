_Update 5/20/19: Well, this was a fun little side project while it lasted. I made pretty good use of this tool while I was an event coordinator for the Filipino Intercultural Society of Drexel University. I will be stepping down from the position of event coordinator in a few weeks, and I no longer have any more event requests to put in. I will be archiving this repository, so that I can use it to show some of the code and side projects I have made as a student. This repository will be open to be forked, for anyone that wishes to continue this fun little project of mine. Really, it was a fun time learning about Selenium and watching this script auto-fill information on all those pages. Take care Event Request Bot, I will miss working on you._

_Totally forgot to mention why I need to drop this project. Since I'm no longer an event coordinator in Drexel's system, I will not have access to the event request forms, so there's no way for me to use or test the script any longer. Therefore, I will need to discontinue this side project since I can no longer operate it._

# Event Request Bot (IVP Bot)
Are you an event coordinator of a Drexel Student Organization? Hate filling out those tedious event requests on DragonLink? If so, have no fear, for the Event Request Bot is here! This bot will ask you a few questions about the event you want to submit into Drexel's system and the bot handles the rest!

# How to run
run `python3 main.py` in the /src directory

## Why did I build this?
Event Services at Drexel University makes me fill out these event requests every time I want to request a room for an event held on campus. That's fine and all, but the paperwork becomes really tedious as there are a lot of redundant questions and for the most part that doesn't really change from event to event (such as orgID, is this org new, etc.).
At the same time I also **really** wanted to learn Selenium, so this project serves as both an actual need, and experimental learning. Also, it helped me brush up my Python after coding exclusively in Java and JavaScript for the last 6 months during my internship at Oracle.

## Who would use this?
- Me
- Event coordinators at Drexel University who submit event requests through DragonLink for Student Organizations and have an understanding on how to run Python programs.

But mainly just me :]

## Why write it in Python?
Honestly, I was on the couch watching YouTube videos when I came across a Selenium video written in Python. I immediately went to work on this program after watching it, and didn't really think to use a different language. Also the extra Python practice helps right before I start taking this AI class at Drexel (CS380 - Artificial Intelligence), so yay double dipping?

This project started on 3/26/2019, right before Spring term classes started on 4/1/2019 (for reference).

## How long do you plan to support this project?
Ideally until June 2019. After that, I will no longer be considered an event coordinator in Drexel's system so my account will no longer have access to the event request pages. So basically, I couldn't support it if I even wanted to, since I wouldn't have access anymore.
